// This is a template bridging header that contains all necessary header
// includes. If your project has an existing bridging header, you can copy
// the relevant includes to that header. If your project does not have a
// bridging header, you can uncomment the relevant lines and use this file
// directly.
//
// Note that the headers listed here include other headers, so the entire SDK
// include directory should be kept in tact. Directly including these is enough
// to get the associated Swift classes to build. You should uncomment only the
// includes associated with the classes you need, and only include the classes
// you really need in your project. There is a derivation chain, so you need to
// include all base classes in your project as well.

// Base (MteBase) includes. These are required to use any part of MTE.
